      <h2>My Favorite Hobby</h2>
      <p>
        My favorite hobby is reading. I find immense joy in getting lost in
        a good book and exploring new worlds crafted by talented authors. 
        There’s something truly magical about the way stories can transport you,
        letting you escape reality and dive into different lives, times, and places. 
        Whether it’s a fantasy adventure, a gripping mystery, or a heartfelt drama,
        each book offers a unique experience. I love how the words on a page can stir emotions
        spark imagination, and leave a lasting impact.
        Reading, for me, is more than a pastime;
        it’s a journey into countless worlds and endless possibilities
